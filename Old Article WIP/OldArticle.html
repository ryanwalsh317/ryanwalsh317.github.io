					<h2>The Evolution of Lighting: How we learned to harness it.</h2>
					<p>December 15th, 2020</p>
					<br>
					<img class="mx-auto d-block imgCustomArticleImage" src="OldArticleTopImage.png" alt="A pretty light.">
					<br>
					<p>Light is something we completely take for granted. How can we even see at night, minus the moon and our slight night vision? Through our own created light. We can see through streetlights, lamps, flashlights, etc. Where did we start creating light to see even when there is near to none? Well, let's ask the neanderthals of 50,000 years ago to answer this question.</p>
					<img class="mx-auto d-block imgCustomWide" src="NeanderthalFire.jpg" alt="Little fella near a fire.">
					<br>
					<p class="caption">Neanderthal starting a fire.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The Neanderthals learned how to use a flint to spark a fire to life in around 50,000 BCE, showing their growing intelligence that carries us to today. Scientists knew that they did use fire beforehand, but they didn't know if the Neanderthals just used already started fires, like a lightning strike or forest fire.</p>
					<p>Their next advancement was putting this fire on a stick and bringing it with them as a torch. They used this as a way to explore caves deeper and adventure out into the night without fear of not returning. It was made with a tough shell that would resist heat, and animal fat/grass inside that would catch and stay on fire.</p>

					<p class="caption">Obernact beeswax candles from 6th/7th century AD.</p>
					<br>					
					<p>The next major advancement was the creation of candle wicks. It's not exactly known when it was made or who made it first, but there's been some Greek and Roman candles found in Egypt that seem to hint towards their creation in 4th Century BCE. The candles were made of either beeswax or tallow ( a derivative of animal fat). There's no pictures of any of these candles, as they were either all used up or lost to time.</p>
					<img class="mx-auto d-block imgCustomTall" src="GasLantern.jpg" alt="Gas lamp.">
					<br>
					<p class="caption">A gas lantern that was used on a train for visibility.</p>
					<br>
					<p>People didn't really make any major advances in the field of lighting until the Industrial Revolution. Most people just put candles inside of lantern-like things. Then, William Murdoch decided to use the surplus of gas that was being created by the revolution. The only issue was that the lights had to be lit and put out manually, but other than that, they would constantly be fueled. Many gases were used, those being: Methane, acetylene, butane, propane, hydrogen, and natural.</p>
					<p>Then, the next major advancement was the lightbulb that Edison made readily available. He used a bulb that used electricity instead of gas, making electricity the #1 thing to use for the future. It costed much less than gas and would last significantly longer, at about 1,200 when bamboo filament was used.</p>
