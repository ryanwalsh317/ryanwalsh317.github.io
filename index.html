			<h2>Why does this website exist? Who are you?</h2>
			<p> This website is dedicated to remembering old technology and understanding new technology that have changed the world or are changing the world. It's very important to know of new technology, as new technology could be important to all of our futures and something that we will use forever. Old technology is also important, as we should see how things have advanced and how we could learn from the past shortcomings to look towards better futures. </p>
			<p> Now for me: I am a junior in highschool that is interested in any type of technology, as I want to major in computer engineering. I was born in Cranford, NJ, moved out to Glen Gardner, then came back due to the isolation of a rural environment. I feel that learning about how technologies were and are would help a lot, as being unfamiliar to new things and old can spell doom in a technology field.</p>
