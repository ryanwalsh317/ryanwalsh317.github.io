					<h2>What happens with electric cars' dead batteries?</h2>
					<p>5 May 2021</p>
					<br>
					<img class="mx-auto d-block imgCustomArticleImage" src="NewArticleTopImage.jpg" alt="The average amount of batteries in an electric car.">
					<br>
					<p class="caption">A picture showing the amount of batteries the average electric car has, highlighting the issue of what to do when they die.</p>
					<p>The electric car industry has been spreading at a never-seen-before rate that baffles everyone. The EU hopes that 30 million electric cars will be on the road by 2030. While these vehicles may be carbon-neutral while they are running, the major issue with these cars is that the batteries eventually have to die and be disposed of. Now, how to dispose of these batteries? It's not as simple as just throwing them away due to many reasons.</p>
					<p>The average lead-acid battery can be easily recycled due to its small size and low risk factor, the average electric car battery can't due to its large size and lithium-ion basis. These batteries need to be disassembled by hand in order to get out their useful parts, and these batteries also have a tendency to explode if handled incorrectly. The amount of lithium-ion batteries recycled today appear to be around 5%, which means that many of these batteries could be a possible explosive hazard in a landfill somewhere.</p>
					<p>Recent proposals in the EU will see that all electric vehicle suppliers set up some sort of recycling plan or partner with another company that will recycle it for them. One of the stand-out companies doing this already is Nissan, who is using old batteries for its automated vehicles that deliver parts to workers in their factories. Volkswagen is another company who's already worked something out, as they set up their first recycling plant in Salzgitter, Germany that plans to recycle 3,600 batteries in its first pilot year. Finally, Renault is another major manufacturer who is recycling batteries, as their plants recycle all of their car batteries. Granted, they only recycle around 200 batteries per year, but it's better than nothing. They are planning to branch out to other companies though, as they feel that they have too little batteries.</p>
					<p>The other major issue with recycling batteries is that it takes a very long time. It's also very inefficient due to the amount of material that can be recovered by the process, as well as the amount of people that have to be paid to do this. Most of the recovered material is "black mass", or a mixture of lithium, manganese, cobalt, and nickel that can't be separated. These materials would need a much stronger force to take them apart, but it would cost a lot of money to do so. Most of these companies are aiming towards an automated robotic line, as they want an efficient and cost-effective way to pay for these batteries as well as not paying a billion workers for each individual step. It also doesn't help that they are very precise, due to the whole exploding thing.</p>
