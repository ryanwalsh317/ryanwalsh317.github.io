					<p>Companies that sell consumer electronics in the European Union now need a serious task that's going to be hard for them to fulfill: 10 years where their devices still have to be repairable. The European Parliament recently voted on stronger "Right to Repair" rules, which will reduce electrical waste and benefit the consumer.</p>
					<p>The general definition of a repairable device is a device that you don't have to get special tools for or break open the device to repair it. Under these rules, manufacturers will have to ensure spare parts are available for up to a decade after something releases and that devices will have to come with repair manuals so that the consumer could easily repair their device.</p>
					<p>The average person generates 16 kilograms of electrical waste, with half of that junk being broken household appliances that can't be repaired. Recycling is also notoriously bad, with only 40 percent of it actually going to its proper place. This leaves a lot of hazardous material that could kill many animals and plants for generations to come.</p>
					<p>It doesn't help that many devices are being made to only last just past their warranties, like iPhones and Samsung devices. Environmentalists have started to accuse these companies of doing this intentionally. Although, if a device has to last 10 years under these new regulations, then higher-quality devices will come out due to them not having a short predetermined lifespan. The next step that people want to be taken with "Right to Repair" laws is to expand these to smartphones and computers, where they are lasting only 2-3 years. That's going to be tough though, as these companies will likely lobby all over the place to prevent these extra laws from passing.</p>
					<p>The good news for us American folk are that "Right to Repair" laws are being introduced in congress, with decent bi-partisan support. There's been no nationwide appliance of it yet, but Congress seems to be mostly on consumer's sides with this one.</p>
