					<h2>How did the Colonial Pipeline get hacked?</h2>

					<p>The recent hack on the Colonial Pipeline is seen as one of the worst attacks on critical national infrastructure in history. The pipeline transports nearly 50% of all the east coast's fuel and oil supplies, and prices at pumps are expected to rise the longer the pipe is shut down. But this may make you wonder: How was a pipeline hacked?</p>
					<p>Well, the main reason why the pipeline could be hacked is that most pipelines nowadays are digital. Things like pressure senors, valves, pumps, and thermostats keep the supply of diesel, jet fuel, and petrol consistent without major issues for hundreds of miles. There's even a giant "smart pig" robot that moves along the inside of pipes and checks for anomalies to be repaired before it causes any major issues. All of this is connected to one major system to have them all run together. Which means that since things are connected digitally, there's a risk of hacking.</p>
					<p>So, how did the pipeline get hacked? Well, it likely got hacked through the opening of an email by someone who worked there who just happened to run the ransomware responsible for shutting down the entire pipeline. And it's not like this kind of thing is new. In February of this year, a hacker gained access to the water system of Oldsmar and tried to poison it by pumping a dangerous amount of sodium hydroxide into it, but it was stopped before it got into the supply.</p>
					<p>The group responsible for the attack is DarkSide, a new ransomware gang that seems to be based in Russia, but that isn't absolute. The group has come out and said that they didn't want to explicitly target the pipeline and were just doing it for money, but this still shows the major power of ransomware gangs and how they could ruin an entire country through one small mistake. They even said that they were going to donate some of the extorted money to charities, how kind of them! Now for them to go onto their next target and possibly do worse damage...</p>
					<p>Now, how can these kinds of incidents be prevented? Well, the government, for one, needs to prevent ransoms from being paid in secret so that these kinds of businesses don't continue. It also needs to put pressure on countries like Russia, Iran, and North Korea, who are three major countries responsible for hosting these kinds of groups. Finally, our own internal cybersecurity has to be up to snuff too. If we can't protect against these kinds of attacks without government intervention, well, let's just say it'll get much worse from here.</p>
					<p>EDIT: As of May 13th, Colonial has announced that they actually paid the ransomers upwards of $5 million, even after saying that they wouldn't pay them as they didn't want to finance those kinds of people. This was, of course, mostly due to the passive panic of gas completely stopping, but it still highlights the need for cybersecurity, no matter how large or small the business is.</p>
