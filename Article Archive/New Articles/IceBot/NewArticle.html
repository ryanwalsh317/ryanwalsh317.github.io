					<h2>IceBot: The newest space exploration device!</h2>

					<p>Remote-controlled rovers have been used in space exploration for about 40 years, starting with the Apollo 15 that landed on the moon in 1971. The only problem is that these robots eventually decompose and fall apart due to the rough landscape. The Curiosity land rover has severe tire damage and is only barely operating, with no way to recover it. A similar fate befell the Opportunity when it ran through a dust storm, destroying its "opportunity" to recharge its battery and dying. These robots cost millions, not including the way to get there and the costs to make sure its alive. That's why people are searching for a better robot - and ice might be the solution.</p>
					<p>A robot made out of ice would be able to repair itself if on an ice moon. This brings up the possibility to have self-repairing, augmenting, and even replicating robots on the moon. GRASP Lab's IceBot is a proof of concept for this kind of robot, which has proven successful to move about and be easy to repair and replicate with only remote-control access. These robots would be able to climp up hard, rubber surfaces and icy, inclined ramps, as well as being able to travel in any sub-zero places like Antarctica. </p>

					<p>This kind of robot, of course, is still very new. The main issue is how to get it to repair and manufacture new parts if an old part breaks. You can't just sculpt a perfect piece of ice from anywhere! You'd need to have it be perfect and precise with no errors at all. Researchers have been considering 3D printing, molding, and machining (cutting materials via metal). Everything has pros and cons, making it hard to think of some sort of perfect solution.</p>
					<p>Another issue with this kind of robot is to have some way to mold the joints together without using screws or any other type of fastener. These fasteners would eventually wear out, leaving the robot stranded due to it not being able to conjure up another one. The final issue is the issue of being able to get the best connection strength without sacrificing too much energy to create them, as energy from the sun, especially on a faraway planet, will be incredibly difficult to get.</p>
