					<p>Premier League giants Manchester City are stepping into the cryptocurrency arena with Socios.com to launch their $CITY token. Socios.com, the fan engagement app which is built on the Chillz blockchain, now allows Manchester City supporters to use tokens to access exclusive rewards like promotions, games, AR-enabled features and possible votes in club polls. Edit: The tokens are also fungible, meaning that they can be exchanged for money. Though, this isn't the first company to add cryptocurrency to their team.</p>
					<p>The Rangers added Bitci to their official fan club, creating more than €5 million (About 6.4 million USD). Some other teams that have added cryptocurrency to their teams would be FC Barcelona, Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain, AS Roma, Atletico de Madrid, Galatasaray, and Trabzonspor. All of those teams have also made decent returns on their investments. The Manchester City token is the first UK token, and Alexandre Dreyfus, CEO of Chiliz and Socios.com, says that, "We are very proud to have Machester City to launch our first fan token in the UK and even more excited with the other teams that are lined up."</p>
					<p>He says that even though these tokens are in their infancy, they clearly have appeal that could definitely make millions. He's also focusing on adding more teams in Asia, Latam, Turkey, and other emerging countries with upcoming teams. You also don't have to be in the country that the team is in to participate in the app, which makes it so worldwide fans can easily participate with their teams (especially in a COVID-19 environment).</p>
					<p>Currently, according to CoinMarketCap (a very reputable price tracking website for crypto), Chiliz's fan token market cap recently exceeded $400M. Chiliz itself also has about a market cap of $3.3 billion dollars. If you sign up for the Socios app right now, you could get a free Manchester City token through a voucher code to be released soon.</p>
