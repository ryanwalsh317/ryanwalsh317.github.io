					<h2>Academics turn RAM into Wi-Fi cards to steal data from air-gapped systems.</h2>
					<p>December 18th, 2020.</p>
					<br>
					<img class="mx-auto d-block" src="NewArticleTopImage.jpg" alt="Some ram sticks that could be converted.">
					<br>
					<p>Some students from an Israeli university have published a paper on how to convert a RAM stick into an impromptu wireless emitter and transmit sensitive data from inside a non-networked air-gapped computer that has no Wi-Fi card, called AIR-FI. The one behind this paper is Mordechai Guri, the head of R&D at Bem-Gurion University.</p>
					<p>If you're wondering what an air-gapped computer is, it's a security measure that has a computer isolated from unsecured networks (Internet, LAN). These types of computers mostly get information from USB sticks. They are mostly used in government processes that hold lists and such, as they don't want an easy way for the information in these computers to get out.</p>
					<p>The basis of how Guri's system works is that all electronic components generate electromagnetic waves as currents pass through. Since Wi-Fi is radio waves, which are pretty much electrical waves, he argues that malicious code could be inserted on an air-gapped system by manipulating the electrical current inside of the RAM to mimic Wi-Fi. This allows anyone to write a program into anyone else's computer with Wi-Fi capabilities, up to 100b/s. A video of this working is below:</p>

					<p>This kind of attack is insanely easy to pull off, as the attacker doesn't need any sort of password, username, information, or anything. They only need a ram stick in a computer that can send out Wi-Fi like frequencies and they can add code to pretty much anything. It even effects VMs (virtual machines).</p>
					<p>Guri has suggested some ways to counteract this, like having Wi-Fi jammers nearby one of these systems, but that's about the only thing to prevent this sort of attack. You can also completely remove the Wi-Fi part of your device, but that's a little difficult sometimes as it may be integrated with the motherboard.</p>
					<p>These kind of attack developments aren't new for Guri and his team, as he's developed things like the LED-it-Go, a way to get data from a HDD's activity LED, and USBee, a way to make a USB connector's data bus (aka the way it connects to the motherboard) give out emissions that can reveal data.</p>
					<p>In conclusion: Computers are never safe. Someone can always hack into anything that is producing electricity. So... just don't use technology, and you'll be perfectly safe! Jokes aside, it's amazing how people can modify RAM into an impromptu malware injecting device, but this probably won't be used on you or anyone for a while.</p>
