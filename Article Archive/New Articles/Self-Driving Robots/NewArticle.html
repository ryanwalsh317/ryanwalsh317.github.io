					<h2>Self-Driving Robots hit Japanese streets for delivery</h2>

					<img class="mx-auto d-block imgCustomArticleImage" src="NewArticleTopImage.jpg" alt="Image of Rakuten's bot.">

					<p class="caption">Rakuten's bot, which delivers food to people stuck inside due to the lockdown.</p>
					<p>Imagine a robot coming up to your door, then politely knocking and serving your food. Well, come back to reality! It's a thing in Japan, where Japanese companies have started to roll out autonomous bots capable of serving piping-hot food and drink all without contact or risk of spreading COVID-19.</p>
					<p>Rakuten, seeing an industry unfulfilled due to the need for social distancing and the prevention of COVID-19, created this specific bot. It can navigate streets and sidewalks with its built in sensors that can detect red lights on streets and avoid pedestrians walking by. Rakuten is an eCommerce giant which hopes to aid its aging population avoid the winding roads and steep slopes of Yokosuka City, the place where the robot is being tested.</p>
					<p>The Japanese government has been more accepting of these new robots, as they used to need a person walking by it. They're considering letting the bots roam free without any human companion, but there's 2 major issues that the companies need to solve: Traffic safety and cost.</p>
					<p>The bots are getting many safety mechanisms, they need to be seriously checked over before they can possibly be on the road alone. The cost is also another major issue, as they need to be rigorous training and tests before they can be street-ready.</p>
					<p>If Rakuten can overcome this issue, they can charge into a new market within a couple of years. Similar services have been popping up all over the world in places like the US, Europe, and China. China even has self-driving robots in Shenzhen. Japan wants to get more people affiliated in this business, as they don't want someone to have a monopoly over this kind of business.</p>
