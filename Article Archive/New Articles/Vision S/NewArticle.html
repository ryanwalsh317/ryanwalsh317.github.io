					<h2>Sony's Vision-S electric car begins public road tests in Europe</h2>

					<p>Sony's new idea for a car is testing on European roads right this second. The major shock about this reveal at 2021 CES (Consumer Electronics Show) is that the car was only revealed one year ago at the same show, so with the car being in early testing, it's only a matter of time until Telsa has a decent competitor. A video of the car driving around is below:</p>

					<br>
					<br>
					<p>The concept revealed last year was very finely detailed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6fHmNvvEcE&feature=emb_title" target="blank">(As seen here)</a>, so many thought that the car was a decent ways along, but it's still amazing that it is coming out this fast. The prototype has many of the similar features that were visible back then, like with its external camera pods instead of sideview mirrors and its widescreen display instead of a square dashboard like most cars. </p>
					<p>Sony's been mostly silent on how the car is going, due to them wanting nothing to leak out about how it's being developed/what it's using. They do see cars as another extension of their business, making them another future competitor for electric car manufacturing. </p>
					<p>The company got into development of these cars due to the expansion of electric powertrains (essentially the engine and mechanisms that push the car forward) and that they had a lot of applicable technology that could be put into a car just wasting away. They have been collaborating with Magna, an automotive supplier, to build the initial base and chassis for the car.</p>
					<p>At the time of the Vision-S unveiling, Magna said that they didn't develop the entire car chassis, so there may be some other companies involved in the planning for the Vision-S. No-one knows for certain though, as the car is in its infancy of production. Now, only time will tell if Sony can go up against Tesla and Audi to take the reigns of the electric car champ.</p>
