					<h2>New Startup "Healthvana" Wants to Add Vaccine Tracking to Apple Wallet</h2>

					<p>Los Angeles County is going to be a test for digital tracking and proof of COVID-19 vaccinations, and it will also give patients notifications when they need their second shot.</p>
					<p>A digital startup named Healthvana wants to start the process of having digital vaccine data so people can easily prove that they have been vaccinated for concerts or airlines, as well as have their notifications for a second dose of the vaccine when it's needed. Healthvana has partnered with Los Angeles County to go forward with their plan.</p>
					<p>The initiative was initially planned for just getting the second dose, but they're considering expanding it for verification due to the simplicity of it. The vaccination card would be shared into the Apple Wallet and could be pulled out whenever the user requested it. This technology will greatly benefit the public, as you wouldn't have to carry around a vaccination card or anything else, you'd only need your phone.</p>
					<p>The second-dose notification is especially useful, as the president of the Vaccine Preventable Disease Control Claire Jarashow said, "We really want people to come back for the second dose, we just don't have the capacity to be doing hundreds of medical record requests to find people's first doses and when they need to get their second."</p>
					<p>Healthvana started in 2014 as a company to deliver test results for HIV and other sexually-transmitted diseases, but they went into COVID-19 tests after they saw the lackluster response of testing from the US government.</p>
					<p>There are decent concerns of data collection from Healthvana's upcoming monopoly on this service, but Jarashow weighed in and stated that they had worked through those issues already. The data is stored on Amazon Web Services' servers, according to Healthvana CEO Ramon Bastani.</p>
