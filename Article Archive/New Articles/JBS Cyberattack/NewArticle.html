					<h2>One Fifth of U.S. Beef Plants Wiped Out by JBS Cyberattack</h2>
					<p>3 June 2021</p>
					<br>
					<img class="mx-auto d-block imgCustomArticleImage" src="NewArticleTopImage.jpg" alt="One of the many JBS meat plants that was shut down.">
					<br>
					<p class="caption">One of JBS's many meat plants across the US, which got shut down due to a cyberattack incident.</p>
					<p>JBS SA, the largest meat producer globally, has made "significant progress" to resolve the cyberattack that impacted its global plants, and should have most plants operational by now. The attack forced the shutdown of JBS's U.S. beef plants, which are the facilities that account for almost a quarter of all American supplies. All other JBS meatpacking facilities experienced some level of disruption too.</p>
					<p>The weekend attack on the Sao Paulo-based company's computer networks forced shutdowns iat slaughter operations across Australia and idled one of Canada's largest beef plants. It's not exactly clear how many plants were affected, as JBS has yet to reveal those details. The global shutdown upended agricultural markets and raised concerns over food security, as hackers are targeting more and more critical infrastructure. A notorious Russia linked group known as REvil or Sodinokibi seems to have been behind the attack.</p>
					<p>While it's unclear if all of REvil's hackers operate in Russia, the group's public face exclusively publishes in Russian. The group typically uses a blog titled "Happy Blog" to name/shame the victims when they decide to engage in ransom negotiations. As of now, there has been no item dedicated to JBS. The JBS attack came just three weeks after the Colonial Pipeline hack, which also was against critical infrastructure and led to many issues nationwide. It also had the supposed hack source be from Russia. The JBS attack has also highlighted America's instability of its food supply, as the attack on the plants prevented the U.S. government from releasing some key meat-pricing data that agricultural markets rely on daily.</p>
					<p>Retailers often don't like to hike up prices on food items, and it is still unclear exactly how much damage this has done to the U.S. market. Livestock producers could also see some more immediate blow, as slaughterhouse closures are continuing due to too many animals being shipped to it, and too little places to send it to before the meat rots. In the end, this incident highlights that once again, cybersecurity is incredibly important. As if a business or body isn't up to date, the entire country could collapse in a matter of days due to the sudden removal of it.</p>
