					<h2>The "Apple Car": Is it a thing?</h2>
					<p>10, February 2021.</p>
					<br>
					<img class="mx-auto d-block" src="NewArticleTopImage.jpg" alt="The Apple logo, the mainstay of the Apple brand.">
					<br>
					<p class="caption">Apple's logo, which will undoubtedly be on the car.</p>
					<p>Yes, I'm talking about another car. I mean, cars are a lucrative business that are doing well, and these companies just have parts lying around that could be a car, so there. Now, onto the article.</p>
					<p>The long-rumored Apple car may actually be credible, as Apple has supposedly reached out to Hyundai to get its car produced in a Kia plant in Georgia. The cars would be specifically Apple branded, and they would be ready to start constructing the car (in factory assembly) in 2024. This is mostly based on Hyundai's January statement, which told that it was in talks with Apple. Apple didn't like Hyundai speaking about it, for obvious reasons.</p>
					<p>Although, that talk may be for naught. A recent Bloomberg report said that Apple's talks with Hyundai had ended with no actual deal being reached. Hyundai also confirmed in Bloomberg's report that it wasn't in talks with Apple, which once again Apple refuses to comment on.</p>
					<p>Apple has been trying for the longest time to get a car out with nothing getting accomplished. The talks with Hyundai do give it promise though, as these memos could show that Apple is far along with its idea and could show the world what it's next major plan is. It will definitely take a long time though, as building a car from a company who has not made cars before is a long and arduous process that will take a lot of time. You have to draft it, crash it a billion times to make sure it's fine, add all-new technologies to it to make it useful to the consumer, make sure these technologies work, make sure the car can be mass produced, etc. It doesn't help that the company also likes doing its own thing, as seen with its phones, computers, operating systems, and even internal chips with the M1 Macbook chips.</p>
					<p>Apple has been working on a car for a long time though: in 2008, Steve Jobs considered an electric car, in 2015 Project Titan (a considered car) was greenlit by Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, and Apple had gotten a permit from California's Department of Motor Vehicles to test self-driving cars. Many people were laid off of Project Titan by 2019, but it eventually acquired a small-time startup that was working on self-driving cars. Apple Insider, an Apple rumor blog, has been cataloging patents from Apple, which include motors and self-tinting windows, suggesting an automotive.</p>
					<p>Finally, Apple's been looking into cheaper and more powerful batteries, as they want a better electric car battery that can power a car for much longer and cost them significantly less than the average car battery. This is evident in Apple's recent focus on improving battery life on its phones, as Apple continually brags about its longer and longer battery lives.</p>
					<p>In conclusion: is an Apple car being worked on? The answer would be, yeah, it probably is. It just won't come out for a while, as they have to jump through many hoops and they also have to get a decent manufacturer to work on the car, which Apple hasn't agreed with any yet.</p>
