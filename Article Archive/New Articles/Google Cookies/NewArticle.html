					<h2>Google "Killing Cookies" isn't what it seems</h2>
					<p>10 March 2021</p>
					<br>
					<img class="mx-auto d-block imgCustomArticleImage" src="NewArticleTopImage.jpg" alt="Google's logo.">

					<p class="caption">The logo of Google, the company that the article is about.</p>
					<p>Last week, Google announced that they were going to get rid of all cookies on their browser. That sounds absolutely amazing! No more tracking, right? Of course not. This is just a way of saying that they're done with cookies, and that they're moving onto something else that gives no advertising company any chance to advertise to users unless they use Google's new system.</p>
					<p>Advertising companies are trying to come up with a universal identifier before cookies are completely erased, like using email logins or other unique user identification, but Google is going to try to shut those down as soon as they're found. David Temkin, who is on Google's product management team with their "Ads Privacy and Trust" blog, says that, "these solutions will [not] meet rising consumer expectations for privacy, nor will they stand up to rapidly evolving regulatory restrictions." He also added that Google isn't planning on any alternative way of tracking individuals once the cookie is gone. The blog post is <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/a-more-privacy-first-web/?_ga=2.50328166.1734167186.1615410682-1491090174.1615410682" target="blank">here.</a></p>
					<p>What Google is focusing on is its new "Federated Learning of Cohorts", or FLOC. While cookies track people by their browsing or clicks, FLOC would take any data generated by browsing and put it in a similar group of people's histories, which Google will allow advertisers access to, granted they pay a little bit of a fee. This may seem a slight bit more private than other random companies having your data, but now it just means that Google has a monopoly on everything, which is equally (if not more) concerning.</p>
					<p>The other main issue with the blog post that they have wrote is that many things are glossed over / just not talked about for the sake of a flashy headline. They say that people don't want to be tracked, but FLOC is still 100% tracking. It also doesn't help that their "95% as effective" claim has pretty much no data other than them saying it is. It's explained more in-depth <a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/online-advertising/the-industry-reacts-to-googles-bold-claim-that-flocs-are-95-as-effective-as-cookies/" target="blank">here,</a> with many more advertising people weighing in on it. In conclusion: when Google says a nice thing, it's usually a lie.</p>
