					<p>A new malware is sweeping across Macbooks, which hasn't done anything yet, but is able to infect any type of Macbook. Even the new Macbooks with Apple's M1 chip are still able to be infected, which is very concerning due to it being able to infect new computers that came out a few months ago. The main thing that's scary about it doing nothing is that it could do something majorly damaging or dangerous, like anywhere from stealing many files off of a user's computer to scan for passwords or such, or even possibly use a hardware fault to destroy the system.</p>
					<p>The other major concern is that the malware seems to have some sort of method for detecting tampering with it, making it so that you can't mess with it or else it won't trigger its payload, or what the virus does. Malware researchers also don't know where this virus originated from, as it could have just come from a pop-up ad or it might have distributed itself via the internet. The only thing the virus is doing right now is listening for commands from its operators - which hasn't been able to be traced.</p>
					<p>Update: As of February 24th, the total infected users has been totaled to 39k, showing that this isn't just some random outbreak - it's still occurring.</p>
					<p>Update: As of March 4th, you can remove this using pretty much any relevant antivirus, like MalwareBytes, Kaspersky, or BitDefender. Apple has stopped the signature used to sign this onto your device, so it likely will disappear due to it not being able to spread.</p>
