					<h2>The History of Money: What can I get with this?</h2>

					<p>Money is a fascinating concept. It's just a thing that we've come to know has value, even though it's just a thing. I'm not going to get too much into theories, but it's still strange to think about. But, where did we get this? No other animals do this, so how did we develop the idea of exchange for things? Well, that starts with as far back as the ancient times of prehistory, where nothing was written.</p>
					<p>Once cattle were domesticated in the 9000-6000 BCE's, along with plants, livestock and plants were used as money. Unfortunately though, these things weren't exactly easy to have all the time. So, people realized that they had to keep track of these sort of things in order to prevent someone forgetting. So, debt and credit was introduced, and the need to mark it down arose.</p>

					<p>The establishment of cities in Mesopotamia around 3000 BCE gave creation to one of the most-known forms of currency today - representative money. Farmers would give their grain to the temple, where people marked their payments on clay tablets. Once the payment was made, the farmer would be given a clay token as their receipt, similar to the paper dollars a person receives for work nowadays. This token could be paid to the temple to pay fees. Since the deposits in the temple were usually similar, a basic quantity of crops became used as a unit of measurement for how "much" something was. If someone was trading with something outside of their receptive money, barter would commonly be used due to no universal measurement of how much something was being in place. Although, once trade expanded, the amount of acceptable things decreased due to people knowing their worth. Soon enough, the most common things being traded for things was gold and silver.</p>
					<p>Many other cultures have developed the use of commodity money, which is objects that have value in themselves as well as money. For instance, China, Africa, and India all used cowry shells as a unit of exchange. Mesopotamia eventually switched to the Shekel, a coin that was often made out of precious metals, as the difference between internal and external money was very annoying to many of its citizens. These city-states also further developed the idea of debt, along with legal ramifications of being in debt or stealing/damaging others' owned things. The first physical example of this is the Code of Hammurabi, the best-preserved ancient law code (it was created around 1760 BCE). The code sets amounts of interest on debt, fines for crimes, and compensation for wrongdoing of the law. The reason why metals ultimately took over in many societies was that metals are easily divisible, portable, and hard for the average person to find.</p>

					<p>In about 1000 BCE, money in the form of small knives and spades of bronze were used during the Zhou Dynasty, with bronze replicas of cowrie shells being used prior. The first manufactured coins popped up in China, India, and cities around the Aegean Sea at about 700 BCE. The coins were also all made in different ways, hinting at them being separate inventions of their own. Most modern coins seem to have their roots in the kingdom of Lydia in the Asia Minor, with the coins being disk-shaped and made of gold/silver/bronze/imitations, and the sides have an image made by stamping, like of a human head or animal. The first ruler to set standards for weight and money would be Pheidon, as the Aegean sea soon after had regulated trades and purchases that made these kind of barters much easier. Lastly, the worship of Moneta, a Roman goddess, brought about the name of money itself due to it storing all of the money in the empire.</p>
					<p>In 800 CE, Charlemagne implemented a reform to have a standard coin that was made of the same exact amount of things, as sometimes the metals were impure to get more money. Unfortunately, this didn't do too much due to the problem still being a widespread issue. In 1160 CE, Venice coins were made with 0.05 grams of silver, while England coins had 1.3 grams. The issue resulted in widespread debasement, or the loss in value due to the coin not being made the same way every time. Finally, in the 1500's CE, coins started to be minted from purely sterling silver, which has 92.5% silver content.</p>

					<p>Paper money was first introduced in the Song dynasty in China around 1100 CE. It began development in the 7th century, where paper currency would be distributed locally to prevent the weight of the coins during large transactions. Even though paper currency was used, the original copper coins were still used alongside the coins during the Song dynasty, but the central government soon enough realized the economic advantages of paper money and made them a lot easier to get. Paper money was beginning to be noticed by Europe, as the tales of Marco Polo and William of Rubrick talk about their time in China and how they were using paper instead of heavy coins.</p>
					<p>Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Europe began to trade a lot more with outside countries. As such, they began to use bills of exchange to easily give real amounts of money without having to lug around giant amounts of metals everywhere they went. It also made pirates and other thieves have a much tougher time stealing, as they didn't have a physical "thing" to steal. This also began the role of a "banker", as Goldsmiths during the 16th century were lending and changing money from representative to physical. They also were beginning to need required fees for their services, as both the government and goldsmiths needed a way to profit in the end. The goldsmiths also had their own private hoard of gold, as this allowed them to have the currency of paper hold value. This also created a basic system of credit, as people could get loans through gold money.</p>

					<p class="caption">An example of a $100 bill in America, or a banknote.</p>
					<p>Inspired by the goldsmiths, European banks began issuing banknotes, which circulated in a similar manner to government-issued currencies today. These banknotes were given to someone who would then go to the bank and ask for that amount of money, which is similar to how a check would work nowadays. Many of these banknotes from individual banks are discontinued by now, as governments have much larger reserves that essentially make currency have a completely universal value. It also doesn't help that, if public confidence was lost in the banks, many people could suddenly redeem banknotes and bankrupt the bank.</p>
					<p>Payment cards started to appear during the late 20th century, as they were another easier way to pay that people started accepting. The first major card that was released was the Bankamericard, which was launched in 1958. You now may know that company by its easier name: Visa. Mastercard and American Express were two other companies that joined in, and they are exempt from all state usury laws so they can charge whatever interest they want. The further development of computer systems in the 1990's allowed many payments to be made completely digitally. By the 2000's, most money became digital currency in bank databases.</p>

					<p>During 2008, Bitcoin was created by multiple authors under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The use of cryptography allowed the currency to be completely tamper-proof through the blockchain technology, making it the first decentralized P2P currency. The protocol also solved the double-spending problem where a currency is exchanged twice. Ever since the inception of Bitcoin, thousands of other cryptocurrencies have been introduced.</p>
					<p>In the end, it's insane how money has evolved. It originally was a physical animal or plant, now it's a thing online that can get you many things. Just goes to show that as technology evolves, everything that we thought that we knew could be completely changed in an instant.</p>
