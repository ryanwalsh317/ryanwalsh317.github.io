					<p>On Monday, April 19th, 2021 NASA achieved a first in human technology and machinery. The talented team on the Ingenuity Mars rover got their helicopter to lift 10 feet off the ground and hover for 30 seconds, logging a total of 39.1 seconds of flight on Mars. The video of the accomplishment is below:</p>

					<p class="caption">A video of the the Ingenuity Helicopter's flight.</p>
					<p>The initial flight was completely autonomous, meaning that the device was running through algorithms that it had built in. It couldn't be controlled via joystick, as the device would suffer from a lot of lag due to communication with the device being done via satellite. The device was also only 19 inches tall and four pounds. Many people have been comparing this flight to the Wright Brothers' flight on Earth, which only lasted for a similar amount of time (about 26 seconds).</p>
					<p>Although this flight was successful, there's still many unknowns with Mars and the possibility of flight on it. Mars's gravity is much less, with it only being about a third of what Earth's is, making it that there's less air molecules for the blades of the Ingenuity and other possible future devices to interact with. There's also the fact that the parts of the helicopter will have to be uniquely built due to the helicopter containing unique parts exclusive to it.</p>
					<p>The Perseverance rover served as a lookout for the Ingenuity helicopter due to it being parked on a nearby cliff to chronicle the events of the helicopter, but it also served as a relay for the helicopter to send data from. The Perseverance rover arrived on the planet on February 18th, 2021 with Ingenuity attached to it. The team is prepared to do another flight with the Ingenuity on April 22nd, which if it survives will lead to some more possible test flights.</p>
