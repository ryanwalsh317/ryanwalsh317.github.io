					<h2>Joe Biden Pushes for U.S. to become Leader in Electric Car Production</h2>
					<p>20 May 2021</p>

					<p class="caption">President Joe Biden stops to talk to the media while inside of the Ford F-150 Lightning truck.</p>
					<p>US President Joe Biden spoke in front of a blue banner that said "A future made in America." He also said that the rest of the world is "not waiting", as he called for the government and industry to 
					"step up" to accelerate production. He called his jobs and infrastructure plan "the playbook" to lead the way to electric vehicles. The sale of plug-in electric vehicles is only 1/3 of China, and while China has 800,000 public charging locations, the US has only 100,000. Biden's plan would pump $174 billion into electric vehicle expansion, including $15 billion to build 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations nationwide by 2030.</p>
					<p>Biden's plan also sets aside $25 billion to electrify city buses, $20 bilion to convert 20% of the country's school buses to electric, and $15 billion to boost the Energy Department's research and development of advanced batteries, semiconductors, and other electric vehicle technology. The jobs plan seeks to replace 50,000 diesel transit vehicles with electric versions, convert federal fleets like the Postal service to all electric, provide incentives to encourage the sale and use of electric vehicles, and offer tax credits (basically things that subtract the credit you owe) to jump-start electric vehicle manufacturing. After his remarks, the president made a stop at a Ford testing facility where Biden drove one of the new all-electric Ford trucks.</p>
					<p>The Senate and House are fairly split over the new proposed action. The point that Republicans are making currently is that more money is being spent on cars than roads and bridges, which roads and bridges are no-where mentioned in the bill. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has also pushed for a bill to require all cars on U.S. roads to produce absolutely no carbon emissions, which would set a deadline a decade earlier than the International Energy Agency.</p>
					<p>During Biden's tour of the Ford facility, an employee showed off a charging station, to which he remarked: "You should be able to get in an electric vehicle and drive across the country without having to worry." He also stated that, "We're at an inflection point in America. We're either going to move and take over this area or we're going to be left behind." Now will he actually follow through with this and will it actually go through Congress? That, only time will tell.</p>
