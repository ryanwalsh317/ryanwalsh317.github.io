					<h2>Japan's central bank begins experiments with cryptocurrency</h2>

					<p>Yes, I know that I'm talking about cryptocurrency again. Thing is, many advances have been happening over the course of weeks, so it's important to talk about them.</p>
					<p>Anyways, the Bank of Japan began experiments on Monday, April 5th to study the longevity of issuing its own digital currency, joining in on other banks that have done so. The first phase of the experiment will take place until March 2022, in which the bank will issue, distribute, and redeem a central bank digital currency.</p>
					<p>Afterward, they will move on to the second phase of their experiments, which will focus in on small details, like how much a person can own and how exactly it can be distributed. If necessary, the bank will launch a program that involves payment service providers and end users, ensuring the safety and accuracy of the currency itself, the Executive Director Shinichi Uchida said in a statement last month.</p>
					<p>While the bank has no plan to distribute the currency as of now, the experiments are necessary to lay the groundwork to get the project going. Global central banks are looking at cryptocurrencies due to the fact that they modernize their financial systems, speed up domestic and international payments, and are highly secure/hard to steal.</p>
					<p>Currently, China has been dipping its toes into cryptocurrency by issuing "digital wallets" to its users, which has reportedly been successful. These banks are all state-owned though, so they most likely are heavily controlled and regulated by the government. Also, you have to apply and be accepted in order to get the currency.</p>
					<p>So, will Japan take the leap into cryptocurrency to show the world that it could work, or will the old way of banking be more cemented? Only time will tell...</p>
