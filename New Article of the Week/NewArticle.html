					<h2>The Whole Gamestop Fiasco: What happened!?</h2>

					<p>So, you've likely seen or heard something about Gamestop's stock and Robinhood being a bit of a pain. But, what really happened? And why are many news sources strangely conflicted over this issue? Well, there's many answers to those questions. First off: What really happened? Well, this is gonna take several paragraphs.</p>
					<p> A bunch of Redditors (people that go on the social media platform Reddit) who were on a certain community called WallStreetBets (also reffered to as WSB) would talk about stock prices and what to invest into in a joke-y way. Many of them had a decent amount of money, as they all knew how the stock market worked and the best ways to make a living. They did have a long time rival though: hedge funds like Melvin Capital that liked "shorting stocks". "Stock shorting", basically, is buying stocks at the price they're at currently then holding on to them until later to sell them for their previous market price. This is really only done on stocks on a decline, due to the fact that if stocks rise, they lose money. So then, these Redditors devised a plan.</p>
					<p>The plan was to put a lot of their money into stocks that have been falling for a while, like Gamestop. If people put their money into these seemingly failing stocks, these hedge-fund companies will lose millions, maybe billions of dollars. So, these Redditors decided: "What the hell! Let's do it!" As a result, Melvin Capital and other hedge fund corporations lost a lot of money. And by a lot, I mean billions of dollars. Citadel Securities, another large firm, had to bail out Melvin Capital $2 billion. Many Redditors and others who hopped on the stock gained a lot of money. Many users on the subreddit are saying that they should never sell, as they would be, and I quote, "giant p***ies." After all, if they do sell, they'll give back money to the hedge funds.</p>
					<p>The other major issue was with Robinhood, a stock-trading service "for everyone". What happened was that the platform, after seeing the massive boom in the Gamestop stock, decided to cancel the stock trading, not allowing users to buy or sell the stock that they rightfully bought. In this case, they were stealing from the poor to fund the rich. The major issue with this is that this practice is completely illegal and was not even in their "Terms and Conditions" that users sign to. Many people are trying to file lawsuits against Robinhood, but none have been disputed yet.</p>
					<p>Finally: Why are news outlets being so vague and silent over this whole thing? The White House is bringing this up into their debates! Why are more news outlets not implicating the companies that caused this issue? One simple answer: These major news companies are likely funded by these businesses. These investors fund the news companies, so talking bad about these companies would obviously cut funding. So, most major news sources only say that investors are "baffled".</p>
					<p>So, in conclusion, hedge fund companies suck, this is a real funny situation, and this is really badly explained. This situation shows that if you get a group of people together, maybe, just maybe, you can screw over a corporation.</p>
