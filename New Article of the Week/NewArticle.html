					<h2>Internet Explorer: Finally Put to Rest(?)</h2>

					<p class="caption">The logo of Microsoft's browser, Internet Explorer, which is being discontinued.</p>
					<p>This week, Microsoft finally made the announcement that people have been waiting for a long time to hear: Microsoft is officially discontinuing Internet Explorer on June 15th, 2022. Internet Explorer launched in 1995 and came pre-installed on every Windows device for about 20 years. Its usefulness shouldn't be overshadowed by its popularity though, as it always had major speed, reliability, and performance issues, not to mention the many, MANY security issues that constantly plagued it (for instance: websites in the 2000's could use memory used by the browser and run arbitrary code to steal passwords).</p>
					<p>The main issue with Internet Explorer wasn't that it had bugs, it's that these bugs would often take an incredibly long time to patch. For instance, Google Chrome is constantly updated constantly about every 5-6 days, while IE would get an update about once a month, if not less. The main reason why Microsoft is directly cutting IE is that many users still use it (according to a study in November), with it being the fourth most popular internet browser that is used today. Many hackers still target these users, as they have a decent chance of getting a lot of information from these highly vulnerable users. It also doesn't help that many of these users are older people who don't want to move on to other browsers.</p>
					<p>Microsoft's newer browser, Microsoft Edge, is certainly much better than Explorer. Microsoft is trying to push the last few stragglers left using Explorer into using Edge via their blogs and notifications that pop up on users' computers. One of the first moves the company is making is Microsoft 365, Microsoft's Office programs, will stop supporting the browser on August 17th. Unfortunately, versions of Explorer will still remain on devices that don't receive updates, which could be devices that are critical in manufacturing and infrastructure side of countries. A fraction of a percent is still huge when there's billions of Windows devices worldwide.</p>
					<p>With Windows XP's prolonged death, Microsoft may continue to support some versions of IE for a little bit longer. The server version of Internet Explorer won't lose support, nor will the Explorer that in Microsoft Windows 10 enterprise LTSC (Long-Term Servicing Channel) program. To deal with legacy pages that don't work on Edge, Microsoft has made an IE mode for Edge that can still load these pages. Overall, the average web user shouldn't encounter many major issues switching to a new browser. The only issue is: Old habits die hard, and change can be annoying to users. So, Explorer will likely haunt the web for a little longer than Microsoft says.</p>
