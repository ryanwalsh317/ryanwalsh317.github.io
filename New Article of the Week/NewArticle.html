					<h2>The languages that destroy auto-translate</h2>
					<p>24 March 2021</p>
					<br>
					<img class="mx-auto d-block imgCustomArticleImage" src="NewArticleTopImage.png" alt="Google Translate logo.">
					<br>
					<p class="caption">Google Translate's logo, one of the most popular translation applications to date.</p>
					<p>If there's a message in Spanish or German, typing it into a translator will spit out a semi-decently translated message that gets the point across. The problem is, what if you wanted to translate Wolof, Luganda, Twi, or Ewe, all African languages? You're completely out of luck unless you have a native speaker. This is because of the algorithms that power translation engines learn from human translations - which only cover the most popular languages. The only thing that these machines can rely on are commonly translated texts, like the Bible.</p>
					<p>Google Translate currently only offers 108 languages, while Bing Translator only has around 70. There's more than 7,000 languages that are spoken in many different places, along with 4,000 with a unique writing system. One nation that struggles with this greatly is Nigeria. About 500 different languages are spoken, which no human could remember all, even a tenth would be an extreme challenge.</p>
					<p>To try to break this barrier, the IARPA (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, branch of National Intelligence) is trying to create a system that can find, translate, and summarize information from any low-resource language. The way that this will be done is through neural network technology, which is a form of AI that mimics human thinking. Google Translate has been using neural networks for a total of 5 years now with its translations. The issue with this though, is that models usually need to go through thousands, if not millions of training text to be able to translate accurately. The challenge that the creators of this AI will have to face is that they need accurate translations from a small pool of text, like a human.</p>
					<p>Since the project began in 2017, the teams have worked on eight different languages, including Tagalog, Somali, Kazakh, and Swahili. One breakthrough discovered is the harvesting of text/speech all over the web in news articles, videos, and blogs. Thanks to people posting in their native languages, there's a lot of data from people who speak low-resource languages. The only issue with this though is that most of these sources are only in their own original language. But, this is solved through pre-training on monolingual data in many different languages. Essentially, the bots can learn structures and features of language in general, which then is applied to translation.</p>
					<p>Another major issue with translation is that some sounds, names, and places the AI will not know and may not be able to translate accurately. For instance, there could be someone of political importance that is relatively unknown, but then that person is assassinated. How do you get that person's name into audio? One possible solution was to go back to words that were transcribed with uncertainty, then try to apply those into what that is. The only issue is that in these summaries the bots have an issue that is referred to as hallucinations.</p>
					<p>These hallucinations are essentially when the bot adds something that wasn't there before, like if an article is about people attacking a building on Thursday, that may get grouped into a translation that has any of those words getting the rest of that. The way to get around this problem is to make bots focus on certain key words so that they don't copy and paste entire segments of useless words.</p>
					<p>The final issue that people are trying to work out is less data-hungry translators. Translation devices run on huge amounts of parallel data, or data that has 2 languages. If translators can start to focus on purely monolingual documents for translation into other languages, so much less data will be needed for accurate translations. So for now, if you want to try to learn a low-resource language, you should probably stick to texts and not robots.</p>
