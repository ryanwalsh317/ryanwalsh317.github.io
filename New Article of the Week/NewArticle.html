					<h2>General Electric's "Monster" Wind Turbine Upending an Industry</h2>
					<p>30 December 2020.</p>
					<br>
					<img class="mx-auto d-block imgCustomArticleImage" src="NewArticleTopImage.jpg" alt="The Haliade-X wind turbine.">
					<br>
					<p class="caption">The Haliade-X wind turbine created by General Electric.</p>
					<p>Spinning above the harbor of Rotterdam is the monstrous wind turbine called the Haliade-X, which generates enough power in one day for 13 megawatts of power, or 12,000 homes. The diameter of the blades is 722 feet, or more than two American football fields, and the structure itself is 853 feet tall. That's nearly two times the size of the London Eye! </p>
					<p>With many sensors that gather data on electricity output, stresses on components, and wind speed, the turbine is just a test for eventual offshore wind turbines that will be assembled in arrays that can power entire cities without any sort of power plant or any other polluting methods of power. These power plants contribute to 2.56 billion tons of pollutants each year, so being able to cut out these plants entirely with renewable sources would be absolutely astonishing for the environment.</p>
					<p>None of these machines have been assembled offshore as of yet, but many investors are shocked with the performance of them. A top executive of the world's leading wind farm development firm has called them a "bit of a leapfrog over the latest technology." These machines are about 1/3 more powerful than the most powerful turbine available in service currently, making many others in the wind turbine business turn their heads to GE.</p>
					<p>Many wind turbine companies are planning to put their turbines at the shores of beaches, as they have much more consistent and powerful gusts that are able to generate much more power than the average wind field. The building of wind turbines has accelerated so much in recent years due to the ongoing climate crisis, which is evident from the Haliade-X generating about 30 times more power than the first offshore machines made in Denmark in 1991.</p>
					<p>While many customers are asking for bigger and bigger air turbines that can power more and more, there may be a point where the size and power generated will plateau and it will not make economic sense to build one as large as possible. Morten Pilgaard Rasmussen agrees with this sentiment, adding that "...we just don't know where it is yet." This kind of thing has happened before with the Airbus A380, which was the largest commercial airliner before it was eventually figured out that any larger planes would cost so much that it wouldn't be worth it to build.</p>
					<p>Even though offshore wind turbines only have 5% worth of the total air turbine industry currently, that is expected to grow exponentially due to the power and reliability of shore wind. General Electric's initial idea with the building of turbines was to crack into a small industry to expand its true power that it could have. With their current turbine, they're planning to take their plans much further due to the eyes on them and the demand for their super-charged turbines.</p>
